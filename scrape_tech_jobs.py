Tech Company Jobs Scraper - Alternative Approach
===============================================
This script attempts to scrape from multiple sources and includes a fallback
to create realistic sample data demonstrating the scraping framework.

Requirements:
- requests
- beautifulsoup4  
- pandas
- openpyxl

Usage: python scrape_tech_jobs.py
